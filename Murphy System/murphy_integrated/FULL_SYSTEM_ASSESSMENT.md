# Full System Assessment (Runtime 1.0)

This assessment consolidates the current state, capability gaps, and a finishing plan required to make Murphy System a fully dynamic, generative automation runtime.

## 1) Executive summary

**Runtime 1.0 is a planning-rich automation platform**: it generates activation previews, gates, swarm plans, org chart mappings, compliance sensors, and learning-loop plans, but most of the execution wiring remains partial. The system is **ready for structured requirement intake and governance planning**, while **execution, persistence, and multi-channel delivery need full integration**.

**Outcome:** the runtime is credible for **planning, governance, and gap discovery**, but not yet a fully autonomous automation engine without additional wiring and operational services.

## 2) What the system does well today

- **Requirements capture & planning:** activation previews enumerate gates, governance policies, org chart coverage, and compliance sensors.
- **MFGC fallback execution:** when the two-phase orchestrator is unavailable, the runtime now executes tasks through the MFGC adapter to synthesize gates and swarm candidates.
- **Governance enforcement planning:** executive/operations/QA/HITL gates appear in previews and policy overrides can be tested.
- **Business automation planning:** Inoni automation loop outputs outline marketing, operations, and QA flows.
- **Librarian context:** curated conditions and approval requirements are generated for each request.
- **Learning-loop plan:** iterative requirement variants are listed with expected output targets.
- **Compute plane validation path:** deterministic compute requests can now be validated through the runtime for structured checks.
- **Execution wiring snapshot:** execute responses now include gate synthesis + swarm task readiness summaries for runtime execution checks.
- **Swarm execution preview:** `execute_task` can invoke TrueSwarmSystem summaries with `run_swarm_execution` to validate swarm expansion coverage.
- **Two-phase orchestrator wiring:** `execute_task` now routes through `TwoPhaseOrchestrator` (`create_automation`/`run_automation`) when the async orchestrator interface is unavailable (validated by `tests/test_two_phase_orchestrator_execution.py`); orchestration defaults to the task type only when the domain parameter is omitted, and responses report a dedicated session ID alongside the automation ID with a `session_id_source` fallback indicator.
- **Persistence snapshots:** execution previews and results can be persisted when `MURPHY_PERSISTENCE_DIR` is configured.
- **Persistence index:** persistence status now includes a snapshot index for quick replay/audit visibility.
- **Persistence replay snapshot:** persistence status now includes replay readiness metadata and the latest snapshot name.
- **Audit snapshot:** persistence status now includes an audit snapshot summary (latest snapshot + count).
- **Observability snapshot:** telemetry bus + ingester stats are exposed in activation previews and system status.
- **Delivery adapter snapshot:** activation previews include document/email/chat/voice adapter readiness; the snapshot is treated as observability sensor data to drive follow-on task cues and delivery confirmations.
- **Delivery adapter test coverage:** snapshot tests validate configured vs. unconfigured adapters and output status handling.
- **Delivery connector configuration:** runtime accepts `delivery_connectors` input to mark adapters as configured for previews.
- **Registry health + schema drift snapshots:** activation previews and system status expose module registry health and configuration drift indicators.
- **Module registry standardization:** `murphy_integrated/src` modules plus local packages are auto-registered into the module catalog with health + schema drift indicators.
- **Adapter execution snapshot:** activation previews include adapter framework readiness for telemetry, module compiler, librarian, and security adapters.
- **HITL handoff queue snapshot:** activation previews and system status expose pending HITL interventions and contract approvals as observability signals for follow-up tasks; resolved statuses (approved/complete/ready/cleared, case-insensitive) are excluded while pending/blocked/rejected remain queued for review.
- **Self-improvement snapshot:** activation previews and system status summarize wiring/info/capability gaps with remediation actions to drive continuous improvement loops.
- **Learning backlog routing:** activation previews and system status include a learning backlog routing snapshot to track iteration queues and training source readiness.

## 3) Critical execution gaps (must close)

1. **Gate synthesis + swarm execution wiring**  
   MFGC fallback now executes gate synthesis/swarm candidates, but full orchestrator execution still needs wiring in `execute_task` and form workflows.
2. **Compute plane + stability controllers**  
   Deterministic reasoning exists but is not invoked for tagged tasks.
3. **Persistence + audit trails**  
   Snapshot persistence + audit snapshot summaries are available when configured, but durable replay/audit storage is still missing.
4. **Multi-channel delivery adapters**  
   There are no production adapters for document/email/chat/voice output.
5. **Operational services**  
   Remote access invites, ticketing, patch/rollback automation, and health telemetry dashboards are still planned (observability snapshots are wired).

## 4) Recommended features to add (priority order)

1. **Execution wiring**
   - Gate synthesis → execution path.
   - TrueSwarmSystem + domain swarms → task expansion.
2. **Persistent memory layer**
   - Central store for LivingDocument, gate history, librarian context.
3. **Multi-channel delivery adapters**
   - Document generator, email sender, chat dispatch, voice/TTS adapter.
4. **Operational telemetry & SLOs**
   - Success rate, latency, approval ratios, failure causes, SLA compliance.
5. **Customer operations automation**
   - Ticketing integration, remote access provisioning, patch/rollback automation.

### 4.1) Competitive feature baseline (industry expectations)

Industry orchestration platforms emphasize **workflow orchestration, event-driven automation, connector ecosystems, governance/audit, and monitoring** as table-stakes capabilities. References: IBM, BMC, Resolve, Redwood, and other workflow orchestration analyses.

**Runtime behavior:** activation previews now include `competitive_feature_alignment` derived from module capabilities and integration readiness.

## 5) Finishing plan (systematic path to full operation)

### Phase 1 — Execution readiness (foundational)
1. Wire gate synthesis and swarm execution into runtime execution paths.
2. Route deterministic tasks to compute plane.
3. Ensure orchestration is online (no simulation fallback).

### Phase 2 — Persistence + audit
1. Store LivingDocument, gate history, librarian context.
2. Add replay & audit export endpoints.

### Phase 3 — Multi-channel delivery
1. Add document, email, chat, voice adapters.
2. Bind outputs to governance gates and approval flows.

### Phase 4 — Operational automation
1. Remote access + ticketing integration.
2. Patch/rollback automation with executive gates.
3. Production telemetry and health reporting.

## 6) Dynamic generative readiness (current vs. target)

- **Current:** deterministic planning + structured previews; execution and delivery are limited.
- **Target:** event-driven execution with durable queues, multi-channel output, and persistent memory.

### Key design upgrades for dynamic automation
1. **Event-driven backbone** (durable queues + retry logic).
2. **Policy compiler** to enforce gates in real-time execution.
3. **Unified adapter layer** for all delivery channels.
4. **Continuous learning loops** tied to verified outcomes and human approvals.
5. **Wingman protocol** pairing executor + deterministic validator per subject.

## 7) Immediate next actions

1. Wire the inactive subsystems listed in [ACTIVATION_AUDIT.md](ACTIVATION_AUDIT.md).
2. Execute the UI attempt script from [SYSTEM_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md](SYSTEM_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md) to validate real execution.
3. Implement persistence and add at least one real delivery adapter (documents).

## 8) Completion checklist (what remains to be complete)

- **Dynamic execution wiring:** gate synthesis and swarm summaries are available; full chain execution must run through the main runtime paths (no preview-only paths).
- **Deterministic + LLM routing:** compute plane and LLM orchestration must both be wired with clear task routing rules.
- **Persistence & replay:** store LivingDocument, gate history, librarian context, and automation plans with replay support.
- **Multi-channel delivery:** document/email/chat/voice adapters with governance approvals and audit trails.
- **Delivery adapter integration:** readiness snapshot is available; connectors can be supplied via `delivery_connectors`, but production adapters remain unconfigured.
- **Adapter framework integration:** adapter execution snapshot is available; execution wiring and activation flows still need integration.
- **Compliance validation:** regulatory sensors, policy gates, and HITL approvals tied to deliverable releases.
- **Operations automation:** remote access invites, ticketing, patch/rollback automation, and production telemetry.
- **Multi-project automation loops:** schedule, monitor, and rebalance multiple automation loops with success-rate targets.
- **Wingman protocol:** executor + deterministic validator pairing for each subject with reusable runbooks.

**Bottom line:** Runtime 1.0 is a strong planning/preview engine. To make it a fully dynamic automation runtime, focus on execution wiring, persistent memory, and channel adapters before scaling operational automation.

## 10) File system cleanup plan

1. **Archive legacy demos** into `Murphy System/archive/legacy_versions/` with clear READMEs.
2. **Remove build artifacts** (`__pycache__`, logs, temp files) via `.gitignore` and pre-commit hooks (including `_workspace_*.zip` for transient UI packages).
3. **Role-based UIs**: keep `terminal_architect.html` (architect), `terminal_integrated.html` (ops),
   and `terminal_worker.html` (delivery) as active role-based UIs; archive unused legacy variants such
   as `murphy_ui_integrated.html` and `murphy_ui_integrated_terminal.html` under
   `Murphy System/archive/legacy_versions/` once references are captured.
4. **Consolidate docs**: move outdated specs to `archive/` and keep a single index in the root README.
5. **Tag active runtimes**: ensure only `murphy_system_1.0_runtime.py` is runnable; mark others as archived.

## 12) Implementation plan to finish remaining work

### Step 1 — Activate execution wiring
1. Route gate synthesis + dynamic swarm expansion through `execute_task` (no preview-only paths).
2. Promote MFGC fallback output into the main execution graph and record success/failure outcomes.
3. Enforce deterministic vs. LLM routing by task tag (compute plane + LLM orchestration in one flow).

### Step 2 — Persistence + replay
1. Persist LivingDocument, activation previews, librarian context, and dynamic chain plans (expand beyond snapshot storage).
2. Add replay endpoints for approval flows (HITL + QA gates).
3. Store gate policy overrides and audit metadata per session.

### Step 3 — Multi-channel deliverables
1. Wire document/email/chat/voice adapters to the governance policy compiler.
2. Track approval status and delivery completion in telemetry and audit logs.

### Step 4 — Operations + customer automation
1. Wire ticketing, remote access invites, and patch/rollback automation.
2. Attach operational SLOs (success rate, latency, approval ratio) to each automation loop.

### Step 5 — Multi-project automation loops
1. Enable scheduler-driven multi-project execution with load balancing.
2. Validate compliance sensors against region-specific requirements before delivery.
3. Attach wingman executor/validator pairs to each delivery adapter runbook.

## 13) Machine learning plan for screenshot-driven chain evaluation

1. **Dataset capture**
   - For each user session, collect screenshots plus the request, gate plan, and dynamic chain output.
   - Label screenshots with outcome status (pass/fail), chain stage, and required fixes.
2. **Capability grading**
   - Score each chain stage on coverage, compliance checks, and deliverable readiness.
   - Highlight low-confidence stages for magnify/simplify/solidify refinement.
3. **Training targets**
   - Train classifiers to predict missing gate wiring, compliance gaps, or incorrect chain ordering.
   - Train ranking models to select the highest-confidence chain path under constraints.
4. **Looped evaluation**
   - Run repeated task variants; compare execution plans and update confidence scores.
   - Feed graded results back into chain planning to promote high-confidence routes.
5. **Operationalizing**
   - Store training feedback alongside session data and gate overrides.
   - Use feedback to auto-suggest gate edits and compliance checks before delivery.
