| Documentation | ✅ Complete | API docs, architecture docs, deployment guides, testing guide complete |

## Regulatory Alignment

Murphy System is **aligned with** (not formally attested to) the following frameworks:

| Framework | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| GDPR | Aligned | Data minimization, consent tracking, right-to-erasure support |
| SOC 2 | Aligned | Audit logging, access controls, encryption at rest |
| HIPAA | Aligned | Role-based access, PHI handling controls, audit trails |
| PCI DSS | Aligned | Payment data isolation, encryption, tokenization support |
| OSHA | Aligned | Industrial safety module templates available |
| ISO 27001 | Aligned | Information security management controls implemented |

> **Important**: "Aligned" means the system implements controls consistent with
> these frameworks. Formal compliance requires independent audit and attestation,
> which has not yet been performed.

## Test Coverage

- **Total test files**: 644+
- **CI configuration**: `python -m pytest --timeout=60 -v --tb=short`
- **CI pipeline**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint (ruff), test matrix (Python 3.10/3.11/3.12), security scan (bandit), and Docker build smoke
- **Core path coverage**: 90%+ on `rosetta_subsystem_wiring` + `startup_feature_summary` (INC-14 / M-05 ✅)
- **Key test suites**: concept graph engine (48), unified control protocol (62), session context (37), crypto trading system (102), shadow learning + real-money guard (48), rosetta wiring (38)

## Known Gaps

| ID | Gap | Priority | Actionable Path |
|----|-----|----------|-----------------|
| ~~G-004~~ | ~~Full ML feedback loop not wired~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `LearningEngineConnector` wires `TASK_COMPLETED`, `TASK_FAILED`, `GATE_EVALUATED`, `AUTOMATION_EXECUTED` events on `EventBackbone` through `FeedbackIntegrator` → `PatternRecognizer` → `PerformancePredictor` → threshold auto-adjustment → `DomainGate.confidence_threshold` evolution. 41 unit tests covering the full loop. |
| ~~G-004~~ | ~~Full ML feedback loop not wired~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `record_outcome()` added to `GeographicLoadBalancer`, wiring feedback signals into `capacity_weight` via configurable learning rate |

| G-005 | Dashboard UI incomplete | Medium | Complete React/terminal dashboard with live metrics |
| ~~G-005~~ | ~~Dashboard UI incomplete~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — Full agent monitoring dashboard at `/dashboard` and `/ui/dashboard`: system health overview, task pipeline visualization, agent monitoring grid, onboarding wizard, metrics charts — all wired to `/api/agent-dashboard/*` endpoints |
| G-006 | Formal security pen-test | High | Engage third-party security firm for penetration testing |
| G-007 | ~~Database persistence JSON-only~~ | ~~Critical~~ | ✅ **IMPROVED** — PostgreSQL wired via DATABASE_URL; SQLite fallback; Alembic migrations; connection pooling configured |
| G-008 | E2EE encryption is stubbed | Critical | Integrate matrix-nio SDK for real encryption |
| G-009 | ~~Management parity Phases 2–8 unvalidated~~ | ~~High~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — All phases verified: collaboration (1,107 LOC), portfolio/Gantt (931 LOC), workdocs (629 LOC), time tracking (484 LOC), automations (495 LOC), CRM (706 LOC) |
| G-010 | ~~JWT/OAuth not in production~~ | ~~High~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — JWT token validation added to FastAPI and Flask security middleware |
| G-011 | ~~Documentation placeholders~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — All 12+ placeholder docs filled with real content |
| ~~G-008~~ | ~~Production deployment hardening~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `SecurityContext`, `PodDisruptionBudget`, `NetworkPolicy` added to `kubernetes_deployment.py` with YAML rendering |
| ~~G-012~~ | ~~Librarian-driven routing not wired~~ | ~~Critical~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `TaskRouter`, `SolutionPathRegistry`, `SystemLibrarian.find_capabilities()` implemented; `IntegrationBus._process_execute()` delegates to `TaskRouter` with graceful fallback to legacy chain; `FeedbackIntegrator` connected via `SolutionPathRegistry.record_outcome()`; 30 unit tests added; `POST /api/librarian/query` endpoint live; PROD-001 (`production_assistant`) and CAMP-001 (`outreach_campaign_planner`) capabilities registered in `SystemLibrarian` |
| ~~G-012~~ | ~~FastAPI silently degrades when module imports fail~~ | ~~High~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `ModuleLoader` framework (ML-001) in `src/runtime/module_loader.py`: `ModuleLoadReport` dataclass, critical/optional classification, fail-fast on critical failures, structured report at `/api/health` and `/api/modules`, startup banner, 23 unit tests |

## Infrastructure Deferred Items

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| INFRA-001 | Redis-backed rate limiting | DEFERRED — in-memory sufficient for single-process |
| INFRA-002 | Post-quantum cryptography (liboqs) | DEFERRED — HMAC-SHA256 hardened; PQC is future roadmap |
| INFRA-003 | SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA formal attestation | IN PROGRESS — requires external auditor |
| INFRA-004 | EU AI Act full conformity | IN PROGRESS — 3/9 compliant, 5 partial |
