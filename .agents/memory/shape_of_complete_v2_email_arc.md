# Shape of Complete v2 — Email Arc Upgrade

**LOCKED 2026-06-10 by founder directive (Corey Post).**

Applies the v1 5-gate framework to every component of the email arc:
direct + ambient + DLF + drill + generative + follow-up + ads +
graphics + verify + ML + dashboard.

## The 5 gates (unchanged from v1)

a) Code exists  b) Wired  c) Deps real  d) E2E executes  e) Visible

Kill criterion: code without verified production execution = theater.

## Email arc — 15 components (snapshot 2026-06-10)

## Ship order — locked

Each ship MUST flip a row from theater/not-built to ALL FIVE GREEN.
No "I built the code" — only "complete vertical slice."

- Ship 31i: rows 4 + 15 (DLF wire + /os/stranger dashboard)
- Ship 31j: row 12 (compliance gate enforcement)
- Ship 31k: row 8 (multipart MIME + branded HTML)
- Ship 31l: row 10 (claim-account flow)
- Ship 31m: row 9 (AdSense / affiliate placement)
- Ship 31n: row 7 (follow-up question generation)
- Ship 31o: row 13 (ML feedback loop)

## Status reporting format (locked)

Every report uses the exact grid above. No prose padding.
No "mostly done" / "almost there" — just gate emoji and verdict.
